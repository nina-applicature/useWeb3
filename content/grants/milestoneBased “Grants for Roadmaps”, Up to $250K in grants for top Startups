milestoneBased is offering a $20K grant for up to 3 of the best projects and roadmap listed on our platform. Winners will be announced in early October, 2022. We will run this every quarter and have earmarked $250 USD for this program till the end of June, 2023. 

milestone Based, the investor-startup collaboration platform powered by a DAO and escrow smart contracts. We are getting rid of the inefficiencies in the traditional early stage funding process by enabling startups to list their roadmaps/milestones on the platform and connect with a community of investors in a more transparent, democratic and capital efficient manner.
